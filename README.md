## About

These are not arbitrary projects:\
I did create that projects-system to solve many problems that I had in the past when I tried to learn web development.\

I will follow something I named it Cumulative Learning, it is somehow intersect with its original meaning,\
But all what it does, is simply whenever I learn something new, I will create a new project that cover that new stuffs, plus all the old stuffs that I've acquired.\
It may sound slow, and it is slow, but to name few of the reasons that I believe that it worth it is:

- MDN has some projects to test the knowledge that we acquire, but it is not enough for me
- I put a lot of effort to understand something .. and because I don't touch it for a long time I simply forget about it or how to use it
- Keep consuming information lead to boredom and lack of motivation
- To use what I know
- To be comfortable with building stuffs.
- By time, I will be building some interesting & a bit complex things.
  As a summary that system of Cumulative-Learning is A way of learning, revising, practicing, and mastering the topics I learn.\
  And of course to stay motivated and not feeling like I'm burning out.
  > Once I cover it, I will write, and work with it all the time.
