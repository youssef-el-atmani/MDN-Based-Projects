> [!Note]
> Based on the name **MDN-Based-Projects**, someone may think that this repository has some **direct relation** to the well known [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), _but that is not the case_.\
> Everything included here has an _indirect relation_ that I have created by my own. And it is not monitored by MDN by any mean.
> \

> That _indirect relation_ is as follow:\
> I am currently using [MDN Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development) to learn web development.\
> And whenever I learn new stuffs, from the **MDN Learn**, I would create a project that cover what I just learned, and all the old stuffs that I've learned at **MDN**: _and that is the only relation between the current project and MDN_.\

## About

I created this project system to solve many problems I faced in the
past while learning web development.

I follow something I call **Cumulative Learning**. It’s
similar to the original concept, but with my own twist:
Every time I learn something _new_, I build a new project that includes the _new skills_ plus everything _I’ve learned before_.
