> [!WARNING]
> Based on the name **MDN-Based-Projects**, someone may think that this repository has some **direct relation** to the well known [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), _but that is not the case_.\
> Everything included here has an _indirect relation_ that I have created by my own. And it is not monitored my MDN by any mean.
> \
> That _indirect relation_ is as follow:
> I am currently using [MDN Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development) to learn web development.
> And whenever I learn new stuffs, from the **MDN Learn**, I would create a project that cover what I just learned, and all the old stuffs that I've learned at **MDN**: _and that is the only relation between the current project and MDN_.\
> \
> I would like to say that I am not a complete beginner, that's because I was learning Web Dev since 2021, but I've never get too far because I've never committed completely to any of the previous resources that I used.

> [!NOTE]
> The following repo is for my personal use only, I am not creating it with the attention to be used by others,
> But everyone is welcome to use it however they like.\
> As long as they do not do any harm to anyone; _I just felt that I need to say that, so that I wont be responsible if it used badly, even though I can't think that it can be used in a harmful way_.

## About

These are not arbitrary projects:\
I did create that projects-system to solve many problems that I had in the past when I tried to learn web development.\

I will follow something I named it Cumulative Learning, it is somehow intersect with its original meaning,\
But all what it does, is simply whenever I learn something new, I will create a new project that cover that new stuffs, plus all the old stuffs that I've acquired.\
It may sound slow, and it is slow, but to name few of the reasons that I believe that it worth it is:

- MDN has some projects to test the knowledge that we acquire, but it is not enough for me
- I put a lot of effort to understand something .. and because I don't touch it for a long time I simply forget about it or how to use it
- Keep consuming information lead to boredom and lack of motivation
- To use what I know
- To be comfortable with building stuffs.
- By time, I will be building some interesting & a bit complex things.
  As a summary that system of Cumulative-Learning is A way of learning, revising, practicing, and mastering the topics I learn.\
  And of course to stay motivated and not feeling like I'm burning out.
  > Once I cover it, I will write, and work with it all the time.
