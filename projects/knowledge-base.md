## Structuring Content With HTML

### Basic HTML Syntax

#### HTML tags

Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a `<title>` tag could be written as `<title>`, `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, `<TiTlE>`, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.

> In order to keep that in mind, write at least a single element in that inconsistent-way\
> Prettier will automatically transfer those inconsistent-tags to lowercased version, that's okay, do it anyway even if it will not be saved

#### Boolean Attributes (HTML)

A `boolean attribute` in HTML is an attribute that represents `true` or `false`
values. If an HTML tag contains a boolean attribute — no matter
the value of that attribute — the attribute is set to `true`
on that element. If an HTML tag does not contain the attribute,
the attribute is set to `false`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To keep that the `boolean attribute` concept in your mind, write it at least once,\
> Some examples are: `required`, `readonly`, and `disabled`, you can use one of those if you want.

#### Double Quotes

Both single and double quotes are valid, but for consistency stick to `double quotes` whenever you have to choose between them.\
Wrapping HTML attribute values as an example: `class="first-title"`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use only double quotes in your HTML code whenever needed

### Head Elem: Webpage metadata

The head's job is to contain metadata about the document.

> Dictionary: metadata is information that is given to describe or help you use other information

#### title element

The title element are used in `page tab`\
and also as suggestion name when you try to bookmark a webpage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include a `title element` in the `head`.
