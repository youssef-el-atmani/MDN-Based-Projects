## Structuring Content With HTML

### Basic HTML Syntax

#### HTML tags

Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a `<title>` tag could be written as `<title>`, `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, `<TiTlE>`, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.

> In order to keep that in mind, write at least a single element in that inconsistent-way\
> Prettier will automatically transfer those inconsistent-tags to lowercased version, that's okay, do it anyway even if it will not be saved
