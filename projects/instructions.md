## Projects Home

The [projects home](/about.html) should be enhanced with time, but only do the enhancement that is needed and meaningful. Don't just put stuffs there because you know how to apply them.

## When creating new projects

### Home Address

Add `link` to every project that reference to : `the main page`, and name it `Projects Home`.

> This is will make it easy to navigate to all the projects.

### Project Message

Each project document the knowledge that you had at the moment of building it.\
I guess that is a good thing to keep.\
Sometime you learn new stuffs, and you think that an already built project is the perfect ground to start from, if you work directly on the original project, then you will loose that **knowledge documentation**.\

create a copy for that sub-website, and name it `enhanced`, you can even create a separate `branch` for it, and once you finish, you can decide wether it deserve to stay, if so, add a link to it in the **original page** and named it something like _the enhanced version_.\

_the enhanced version_ should be included both in the top and the bottom of the page, and it should be easily spotted.

### Add README.file

It should contains a:

- Live preview link,
- The Hijri date,
- Brief description for the project,

## When Working With Assets

### Compress the images

Use [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) or similar tool to decrease the size of images, in order to improve the performance.

## Once You Finish Building Any Project

### Open It Using Local Server

Open your project-page using `local server`: use the `Node.js` for that\
If you forget here is a how you do it: `npx http-server /path/to/project -o -p 9999`,\
If you need more infos go to: [MDN:How do you set up a local testing server?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server#using_node.js)
