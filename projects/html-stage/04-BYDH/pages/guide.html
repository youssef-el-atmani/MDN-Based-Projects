            The steps included here are not by any mean presented by an expert,

        <section aria-label="home location">
          <h2 id="location">Right Land, Right Home</h2>
          <p>
            When choosing a place to build your house, it's essential to find
            land that is legally owned,safe from natural hazards, and located in
            a peaceful, accessible area with basic services like water,
            electricity, and internet. Consider the quality of the soil for
            building, the direction of sunlight and wind, and whether the
            environment offers comfort and beauty. Make sure the area has clear
            zoning rules that allow you to build, and check if the cost of the
            land fits your budget, including any extra fees for preparing it.
            Think about the community, the long-term value of the location, and
            whether it matches the life you want to live—close to nature, near a
            city, or in a quiet village.

          <p>
            Based on the size of your area, your interest, and your budget, you
            should choose one of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="./detached-house.html">Detached House</a></li>

          <h2 id="building-materials">Building Materials</h2>
          <p>
            That also depends on many factors. To name a few: the type of land,
            the type of house, the environment, the budget, and last but not
            least, personal preferences:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wooden House</li>
            <li>Brick House</li>

        <section aria-label="the personal preferences">
          <h2 id="preferences">The Preferences</h2>
          <p>
            Before building a house, it’s important to start with <em>you</em>.
            Think about what truly matters to you —your lifestyle, your needs,
            and your personal vision of home. These preferences go beyond the
            basics and help shape a space that feels uniquely yours. <br />
            <br />
            Maybe you dream of a quiet reading nook by a big window, a spacious
            kitchen with natural light, a hidden garden, or even a rooftop
            terrace. These aren’t always found in standard homes, but they can
            become part of yours—if you define them early. <br />
            <br />
            Your home should reflect <em>you</em>, not just what’s commonly
            built.

        <section aria-label="meeting the architect">
          <h2 id="meeting-architect">Meeting the Architect</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have a clear vision of your dream home, the next big step
            is meeting with an architect. This is where your ideas begin to take
            shape on paper. <br />
            <br />
            An architect listens to your needs, understands your preferences,
            and translates them into a design that works—both beautifully and
            practically. Whether it’s extra storage space, large windows for
            natural light, or a special room with a view, the architect helps
            bring your unique vision to life.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            This meeting is more than just technical planning—it’s a creative
            collaboration. So come prepared, be open, and don’t be afraid to
            share even the smallest details that matter to you. After all, this
            is your future home.

          <h2>Hire an Expert</h2>
          <p>
            Building a home is a big journey, and having an expert by your side
            can make all the difference. This trusted professional will act as
            your guide—overseeing the architect’s plans, making sure they align
            with your goals, and ensuring the building company follows through
            with quality and precision. From the first sketch to the final
            brick, they help keep everything on track and up to standard.

            Find a Company That Will Build Your Home
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once your plans are ready, it’s time to choose a building company
            that can turn those plans into reality. This is one of the most
            important decisions in the entire process.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Look for a company with a solid reputation, proven experience, and a
            clear understanding of your project. A good builder doesn’t just
            follow instructions—they communicate well, stick to timelines, and
            pay attention to quality in every detail.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ask for past work examples, talk to previous clients if possible,
            and make sure everything is clearly written in the contract. The
            right company will make the journey smoother, safer, and much more
            rewarding.
