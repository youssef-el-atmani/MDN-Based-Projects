            It's the most common, <em>budget</em>, and <em>tasty</em> dessert
            when filled with Ashta, walnuts or even sweetened white cheese!

                <em>Ashta</em> <span lang="ar">القشدة</span> is popular in the
                Middle East and is common as a topping for desserts like fruit
                cocktails and as a filling in sweets, such as Qatayef. Think of
                it like the Middle Eastern version of whipped cream but with the
                texture of mascarpone cheese.

            The fact that this recipe is served and prepared mostly in
            Ramadan "as this article say", and that we are now in Ramadan is a
            coincidence. <br />
            It is not intentional. <br>
            <hr>
            Ramadan is a month where Muslims fast, they fast the whole month. <br>

      <dl>
        <dt>What is the purpose of this page?</dt>
        <dd>The main goal is to practice the things that I've learned until now using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development" target="_blank">MDN Learn</a>.</dd>

        <dt>In your studies, are you using something else to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development" target="_blank">MDN Learn</a>?</dt>
        <dd>For the most of the times, no.</dd>
        <dd>But whenever I find that something is not clear enough, I use Search engine, or YouTube.</dd>

        <dt>Is there any source that you use a lot next to MDN Learn?</dt>
        <dd>As I said, I mainly using MDN Learn, but there is one website that I use a lot because it has deeper presentation on HTML element, it is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WHATWG</a>, <br> it is really good, sometimes I only look at it to see how they will present some element, even though I feel comfortable with it</dd>

        <dt>Does WHATWG linked in the MDN documentation?</dt>
        <dd>No</dd>

        <dt>How did you know about it then?</dt>
        <dd>Coincidence, but I don't believe in coincidence, the right answer is <strong>Praise Be To Allah</strong>: that website helped me a lot.</dd>

        <dt>I see that You include a lot of info in this <em>description list</em>, why is that?</dt>
        <dd>Description lists in a new term for me, so this is a simple practice for it!</dd>

        <dt>So is this is a fake info since it is only practice?</dt>
        <dd>No it is not</dd>

        <dt>Why would you put real info? isn't time wasting?</dt>
        <dd>I could easily generate <br> <q>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Corrupti, quidem.</q></dd>
        <dd>But I don't like that, it is a matter of preference!</dd>

        <dt>Thanks for your time, bye for now!</dt>
