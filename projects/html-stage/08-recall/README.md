# Recall project

- [live preview](https://youssef-el-atmani.github.io/MDN-Based-Projects/projects/html-stage/08-recall/index.html)
- This project was completed in: 23 Dhul-Qi'dah 1446

It has been a long time since the last project, so I had to build this project as a revision of what I've learned until now.\
\
Plus I had stop sometime for some reasons. The best I can do now is to walk through all the stuffs I have covered.
\
\
Another reason for this project is that I usually build an assignment-project after each lesson, but I skipped the one on **HTML Forms**. So this project helps me revise after a 2-week break and make up for that missed assignment.
