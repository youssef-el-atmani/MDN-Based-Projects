# HTML images

An article named [HTML images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images) by MDN.

### üì∑ Using the `<img>` Element in HTML

- **Purpose**: Embeds images into web pages.
- **Essential Attributes**:
  - `src`: Specifies the image source URL.
  - `alt`: Provides alternative text for accessibility and scenarios where the image cannot be displayed.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use descriptive filenames for better SEO (e.g., `dinosaur.jpg` instead of `img123.png`).
  - Avoid hotlinking to images on external servers without permission.
  - Prefer relative URLs over absolute ones for maintainability. ([HTML images - Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### üìù Alternative Text (`alt` Attribute)

- **Importance**:
  - Enhances accessibility for screen reader users.
  - Displays text when images fail to load.
  - Improves SEO by providing context to search engines.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use empty `alt=""` for purely decorative images.
  - Ensure `alt` text conveys the image's purpose or content succinctly.
  - Avoid redundant descriptions if the image's context is already clear from surrounding text.

### üìê Specifying Image Dimensions

- **Attributes**:
  - `width` and `height`: Define the image's display size in pixels.
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents layout shifts as the page loads.
  - Improves user experience by allocating space for images in advance.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use actual image dimensions to maintain quality.
  - Avoid resizing images using HTML attributes; instead, resize images appropriately before embedding.
