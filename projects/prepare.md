## Make a story

You have the **ingredients** and the **constraints**, now try to do something creative with them, If you only have: _eggs_, then you may want to cook them as _boiled_ or _fried_, but if for what ever reason you can not fry the eggs _(a constraint)_ then you can only go with the _boiled eggs_. You can imagine if you have _salt, onion, tomato_: you can make _boiled eggs_ with a salad composed from _onion, tomato, salt_. Or you can make a single meal cooking them all together.\
