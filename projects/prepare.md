# How to build the MDN-Based-Projects

> here I will store the necessary steps that I should follow when trying to build new project for the MDN-Based-Projects

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whenever I will finish a lesson, I will create a simple project, that will cover everything in the [Knowledge-base](./knowledge-base.md), as a simple and straight forward process,\
> I will apply every section that exist in the [Knowledge-base](./knowledge-base.md), section by section.

## ⚠️ I will ignore everything at the bottom for now. ⚠️❗

---

> [!CAUTION]
> It is super easy to get too far and _waste your limited time_ on the wrong stuffs,\
> Do not forget the goal of these projects, **To Practice What You've Learned!**
>
> - If you are in HTML section, _do not waste a second_ on the css or the UI/UX stuffs, keep that when you learn some CSS and you want some practice for it.
> - Do not invest more time than needed for content creation.
>
> **Remember** that **you should move forward _as fast as possible_**!

> [!note]
> A project that composed of a single page that should contain everything you've learned could end like a mess\
> Try to break the project to multiple pages depending on the things you want to implement

## Define the ingredients & constraints

> - The **ingredients** are the things that the projects should be built from.
> - The **constraints** are the way you should use those ingredients.

## Make a story

You have the **ingredients** and the **constraints**, now try to do something creative with them, If you only have: _eggs_, then you may want to cook them as _boiled_ or _fried_, but if for what ever reason you can not fry the eggs _(a constraint)_ then you can only go with the _boiled eggs_. You can imagine if you have _salt, onion, tomato_: you can make _boiled eggs_ with a salad composed from _onion, tomato, salt_. Or you can make a single meal cooking them all together.\

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should create something meaningful, either do it by your own, or use some AI tool to help you.\
> The most important stuffs here and the thing **that you should focus on the most** is using the **stuffs** you have learned, the **story part** add a gentle touch to the process, so that you avoid boredom, and to stay motivated.

### Define the general topic

Choose a topic that looks relevant to the stuffs you want to implement

### Draw the highlights

If the project include some content, and mostly it will, break the content topic to small parts, and then use AI tools to generate content for you.

## Prepare meta data

- Write a description for the project
- choose a favicon
- Keep truck of the attributions

## Define the pages

Define the pages that your project website will have, for example:

- Home
- About

## The Home page

The home page should include:

- The **MDN Lessons** that will be covered,
- Emphasis the new Lesson that you have just learned
  - Provide a brief overview to it, and try to explain it briefly from your memory.

## Write General Page Template

That include everything that is sharable across all the website pages

- `head` element,
- `body` element,

  - `header`,
  - `nav`,
  - `footer`.

Fill all the above elements.
and create the project pages, and distribute the sharable code into them.
