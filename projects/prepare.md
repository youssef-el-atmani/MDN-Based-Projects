# How to build the MDN-Based-Projects

> here I will store the necessary steps that I should follow when trying to build new project for the MDN-Based-Projects

## Define the ingredients & constraints

> - The **ingredients** are the things that the projects should be built from.
> - The **constraints** are the way you should use those ingredients.

## Make a story

You have the **ingredients** and the **constraints**, now try to do something creative with them, If you only have: _eggs_, then you may want to cook them as _boiled_ or _fried_, but if for what ever reason you can not fry the eggs _(a constraint)_ then you can only go with the _boiled eggs_. You can imagine if you have _salt, onion, tomato_: you can make _boiled eggs_ with a salad composed from _onion, tomato, salt_. Or you can make a single meal cooking them all together.\

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should create something meaningful, either do it by your own, or use some AI tool to help you.\
> The most important stuffs here and the thing **that you should focus on the most** is using the **stuffs** you have learned, the **story part** add a gentle touch to the process, so that you avoid boredom, and to stay motivated.

### Define the general topic

Choose a topic that looks relevant to the stuffs you want to implement

### Draw the highlights

If the project include some content, and mostly it will, break the content topic to small parts, and then use AI tools to generate content for you.

## Prepare meta data

- Write a description for the project
- choose a favicon
- Keep truck of the attributions
