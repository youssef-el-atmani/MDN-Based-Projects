    <h2>An Overview</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p class="info">These are not arbitrary projects:
        <br>I did create that projects-system to solve many problems that I had in
        the past when I tried to learn web development.
        <br><br>I will follow something I named it <strong>Cumulative Learning</strong>, it is somehow intersect with its original meaning,
        <br>But all what it does, is simply whenever I learn something new, I will create a new project that cover that new stuffs, plus all the old stuffs that I've acquired.
        <br>It may sound slow, and it is slow, but to name few of the reasons that I believe that it worth it is:
        <ul class="info">
          <li>MDN has some projects to test the knowledge that we acquire, but it is not enough for me</li>
          <li>I put a lot of effort to understand something .. and because I don't touch it for a long time I simply forget about it or how to use it</li>
          <li>Keep consuming information lead to boredom and lack of motivation</li>
          <li>To use what I know</li>
          <li>To be comfortable with building stuffs.</li>
          <li>By time, I will be building some interesting & a bit complex things.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="info">As a summary that system of Cumulative-Learning is <em>A way of learning, revising, practicing, and mastering the topics I learn.</em>
        <br>And of course to stay motivated and not feeling like I'm burning out.
        <br>Once I cover it, I will write, and work with it all the time.
